    "bio": "<p>Since my very childhood I’ve always been passionate about creating something either useful, nice-looking or tasty. This passion corresponds with my hobbies: drawing and cooking. The creation process itself gives me a great pleasure, but even more pleasure comes with the realization that the results of my work bring someone benefit or joy.</p><p>This probably best describes why I’m happy being a front-end developer.Front-end development gave me the best way to satisfy my aspirations and keeps bringing me joy day by day. The things I’m able to create now are both nice-looking, “tasty” and useful. Plenty of frameworks, libraries and tools makes me persistently look for ideas to enhance my creation process hence to polish the results of my work.</p><p>I have a long way to go and I enjoy every step.</p>",
